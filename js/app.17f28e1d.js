It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.","vidoe-text":"Watch the video below to learn about different types of computers."},"hard-software":{"title":"Hardware vs Software","defination":"Every computer is made of two common parts i.e. Hardware and Software.","hard-defination":"Hardware is any part of your computer that has a physical structure, such as the keyboard or mouse. It also includes all of the computer\'s internal parts, which you can see in the image below.","soft-defination":"Software is any set of instructions that tells the hardware what to do and how to do it. Examples of software include web browsers, games, and word processors. Below, you can see an image of Microsoft PowerPoint, which is used to create presentations.","soft-rest":"Everything you do on your computer will rely on both hardware and software. For example, right now you may be viewing this lesson in a web browser (software) and using your mouse (hardware) to click from page to page. As you learn about different types of computers, ask yourself about the differences in their hardware. As you progress through this tutorial, you\'ll see that different types of computers also often use different types of software."},"computer-types":{"title":"Different types of Computer","defination":"When most people hear the word computer, they think of a personal computer such as a desktop or laptop. However, computers come in many shapes and sizes, and they perform many different functions in our daily lives. When you withdraw cash from an ATM, scan groceries at the store, or use a calculator, you\'re using a type of computer.","desktop":{"title":"Desktop","defination":"Many people use desktop computers at work, home, and school. Desktop computers are designed to be placed on a desk, and they\'re typically made up of a few different parts, including the computer case, monitor, keyboard, and mouse."},"laptop":{"title":"Laptop","defination":"The second type of computer you may be familiar with is a laptop computer, commonly called a laptop. Laptops are battery-powered computers that are more portable than desktops, allowing you to use them almost anywhere."},"tablet":{"title":"Tablet","defination":"Tablet computers—or tablets—are handheld computers that are even more portable than laptops. Instead of a keyboard and mouse, tablets use a touch-sensitive screen for typing and navigation. The iPad is an example of a tablet."},"server":{"title":"Server","defination":"A server is a computer that serves up information to other computers on a network. For example, whenever you use the Internet, you\'re looking at something that\'s stored on a server. Many businesses also use local file servers to store and share files internally."},"other-type":{"title":"Other types of computers","defination":"Many of today\'s electronics are basically specialized computers, though we don\'t always think of them that way. Here are a few common examples.","smartphone":"Smartphones: Many cell phones can do a lot of things computers can do, including browsing the Internet and playing games. They are often called smartphones.","wearables":"Wearables: Wearable technology is a general term for a group of devices—including fitness trackers and smartwatches—that are designed to be wornthroughout the day. These devices are often called wearables for short.","game-console":"Game consoles: A game console is a specialized type of computer that is used for playing video games on your TV.","tv":"TVs: Many TVs now include applications—or apps—that let you access various types of online content.

The front of the case usually has an On/Off button and one or more optical drives. Computer cases come in different shapes and sizes. A desktop case lies flat on a desk, and the monitor usually sits on top of it. A tower case is tall and sits next to the monitor or on the floor. All-in-one computers come with the internal components built into the monitor, which eliminates the need for a separate case."},"monitor":{"title":"Monitor","defination":"The monitor works with a video card, located inside the computer case, to display images and text on the screen. Most monitors have control buttons that allow you to change your monitor\'s display settings, and some monitors also have built-in speakers. Newer monitors usually have LCD (liquid crystal display) or LED (light-emitting diode) displays. These can be made very thin, and they are often called flat-panel displays. Older monitors use CRT (cathode ray tube) displays. CRT monitors are much larger and heavier, and they take up more desk space."}},"about":{"title":"English","content":"<strong>english</strong> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet <a href=\'#\'>consectetur</a> adipisicing elit.
